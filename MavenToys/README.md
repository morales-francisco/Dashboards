The Sales Manager from Maven Toys Company request an executive sales report.
Based on the request made by the company, we proposed the following analysis:

- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
- Find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data.
- Discover insights about sales data.
